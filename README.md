Exercises - Basic problems I found on the internet

JokesRepository - First php program. Using xampp - appache as server and phpMyAdmin mysql database
The application uses both session to store the UserId and cookie to store the UserName.
As it's just a training exercise it lacks basic styling.

The application has those functionalities
1) Register / login / Logout
2) Add joke / Read jokes other people posted

The authentication consists of taking the email from the login form and checking if 
a user with such email exists. Other authentication validations such as:

1) Checking / Hashing the password
2) Repeat password
3) Checking if a user with such email already exists

Are currently not present, due to the nature of the application. Maybe someday I'll add them.
